# Nine Lives

Cloned from [Shovel](https://github.com/aksommerville/shovel) at `de91a464728448405762a9e067c9b0839aaf4ce7`.

Entry for js13k 2025, theme "BLACK CAT".

## TODO

- [x] Web: Keyboard stops working after a gamepad interaction.
- - See `gp()` in index.html: We are polling every button once the gamepad connects. Ought to update player state only on _changes_.
- [ ] Remove Laser.
- [x] Switchable gates.
- [x] Breathing fire - burn things.
- [ ] Output video sizing is imperfect. Visible especially at 1x. (xegl). Update Shovel if we fix it.
- [x] Remove AUX1-to-quit before release, at least for web.
- [ ] Eliminate persistence if we're not keeping a high score. Are we? No, no space for it.
- [x] Face the door at init and hatch.
- [x] 13 sensible maps.
- [x] Put maps in order.
- [x] "reset level" key.
- [x] Promo pics.
- - js13k cover: 320x320 (<=50 kb)
- - js13k hero: 800x500 (<=200 kb)
- - itch cover: 630x500

## Notes

Preliminary sizes:
 -  986 caught_the_mouse
 - 1564 get_over_here
 -  636 nine_lives
 -  560 graphics
 - 9625 zipped bundle

That's about 3 kB of music. Could thin it out if needed.
If we're going to reduce it to just one song, as I think we will, why not make that one song ridiculously long?
If we keep it reasonably thin, we could probly get like 5 or 10 minutes of music out of it.

We could probably drop text. Might still need numbers, for presenting the score or clock.

I assumed there would be Hello and Gameover modals. Don't necessarily need those.

Jump: Can ascend 2 meters, not 3. With a single corpse, can ascend 3.
Laterally at same elevation, can clear a 5-meter gap, not 6.

## Map Format

Input is text, a picture of the map using two characters per tile:
 - `.,` = empty
 - `Xx` = wall
 - `Ss` = spikes
 - `Ll` = laser
 - `Hh` = hero spawn
 - `Dd` = door
 - `Ww` = switch
 - `Gg` = gate
 - `Bb` = burnable

There's 220 tiles per map, of which the overwhelming majority will be empty and wall, often in long runs.

```
00cccccc : (c+1) empty.
01cccccc : (c+1) wall.
1000cccc : (c+1) spikes.
10xxxxxx : Reserved.
11000000 : Spawn point (empty).
11000001 : Laser.
11000010 : Door.
11000011 : Switch.
11000100 : Gate.
11000101 : Burnable.
11xxxxxx : Reserved.
```

Neighbor-joining is the runtime's problem, that keeps the encoded data tighter.
Unspecified tiles are wall, so encoder can safely trim those from the end.
First trial map, admittedly a sparse one, is only 30 bytes. Looking good even without a vertical filter.
